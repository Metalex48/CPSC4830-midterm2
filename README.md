Using CNNs to classify images and working with some NLP libraries.

The first challenge in this test is to classify the images from the CIFAR-100 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). To achieve this we create a CNN. We finally test our model to see how it classifies our own images. 

The second challenge is to handle a dataset containing different tweets. Using multiple NLP packages we clean the text, create a wordcloud of common topics, visualize the topics in an Intertopic Distance Map, and we finally use TF-IDF along with Random Forest Classifier to build a Tweet Sentiment classification Model.
